"""Interpret a Load Procedure and execute it over a device connection.

A Load Procedure is an ordered list of Load Controls parsed from the application
program (Load Controls are described in KNX Standard v3.0.0, Volume 2 Cookbook,
02_03_01 "Load Controls"). :class:`LoadProcedureRunner` walks that list and turns
each control into the corresponding bus operation, reading bulk data from the
:class:`DownloadImage` where a control refers to it. The download procedures
themselves - complete download, partial download and unload - follow Chapter 3/5/3
"Configuration Procedures", sections 3.5.2, 3.5.3 and 3.5.4.

Load State Machine control follows the property based Realisation Type 1 (writing
load events to ``PID_LOAD_STATE_CONTROL`` of the addressed interface object, see
Chapter 3/5/1 "Resources", section 4.23); the memory mapped variant used by very
old (BCU) device models is out of scope.

Connection handling follows the point-to-point management connection lifecycle: the transport connection is
opened on a Connect control and closed on Disconnect; a Restart tears it down
(after a cooldown the next control reconnects); and any bus control encountered
without an open connection opens one first (auto-connect). This lifecycle is only
active when the runner is given a :class:`ConnectionManager`; with a fixed
programmer the connection is assumed to stay open (Connect/Disconnect are no-ops).
