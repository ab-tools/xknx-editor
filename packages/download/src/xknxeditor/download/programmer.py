"""Low level device programming operations over a point-to-point connection.

The :class:`DeviceProgrammer` turns the primitive application layer services
provided by ``xknx`` into the operations a Load Procedure needs: chunked memory
writes, property writes, and driving a Load State Machine with read-back
verification. Those services are defined in KNX Standard v3.0.0, Chapter 3/3/7
"Application Layer": A_Memory_Read (section 3.5.3), A_Memory_Write (section 3.5.4),
A_PropertyValue_Read/A_PropertyValue_Write, and A_DeviceDescriptor_Read
(section 3.4.2.1). Memory reads/writes are split to the connection's maximum APDU
length.

It talks to any object implementing :class:`BusConnection`; at runtime this is
``xknx.management.P2PConnection``, in tests it is a fake.
